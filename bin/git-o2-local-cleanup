# doc: Archivuje starší lokální feature branches mergnuté do main/develop

# write me a bash script, that - given the REPO=~/o2/bimain does the following:
# 
# - lists all feature branches on my local copy (do not touch remote!); in the following text, each such branch is refered to as feature/branch
# - for each feature/branch, gets the last commit sha and date
# - checks two conditions, and if boh are met, the branch is renamed from feature/branch to archive/branch (on my local repo, do not touch remote)
# - the conditions that needs to be met:
# 1) the last commit on feature/branch is also on develop branch (feature/branch was merged to develop) and on the master branch (feature/branch was merged to master)
# 2) the last commit is more than 1 week old
